### üö¶ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI Name                         | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Accidents**              | Sum of all reported accidents.                              |
| **Total Fatal Accidents**        | Number of accidents with fatalities.                        |
| **Total Injuries**               | Total injured individuals.                                  |
| **Fatality Rate (%)**            | `(Fatal Accidents / Total Accidents) * 100`                 |
| **Injury Rate (%)**              | `(Total Injuries / Total Accidents) * 100`                  |
| **Highest Accident State**       | State with the maximum accidents.                           |
| **Lowest Accident State**        | State with the fewest accidents.                            |
| **Accidents per 100,000 People** | Normalized accident rate (if population data is available). |
| **Accident Severity Index**      | `(Fatalities + Serious Injuries) / Total Accidents`         |
| **Peak Accident Period**         | Year/Month with the most accidents.                         |
| **Most Common Accident Type**    | Accident category with the highest frequency.               |
| **% Change YoY**                 | Year-over-year change in accident metrics.                  |
