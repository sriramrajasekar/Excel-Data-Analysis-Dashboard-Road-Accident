# 🚧 Road Accident Data Analysis - Excel Project

## 📊 Project Overview

I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.


## 📁 Dataset

**File**: `Road Accident Data.xlsx`  
The dataset contains detailed records of road accidents, including:
- **Accident Types**
- **States/Regions**
- **Total Accidents**
- **Fatalities**
- **Injuries**

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Data Cleaning
  - Charts (Bar, Pie, Line)
  - Data Validation
  - Filters & Sorting
  - Dashboard Creation

#🚦 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#KPI Name	Description

Total Accidents	-- Total number of road accidents recorded in the dataset.

Total Fatal -- Accidents	Number of accidents that resulted in fatalities.

Total Injuries-- 	Total number of individuals injured in accidents.

Fatality Rate (%)	-- (Total Fatal Accidents / Total Accidents) * 100 — % of fatal outcomes.

Injury Rate (%)	-- (Total Injuries / Total Accidents) * 100 — % of accidents with injuries.

Highest Accident State/Region	-- The state or region with the maximum number of road accidents.

Lowest Accident State/Region	-- The state or region with the minimum number of road accidents.

Accidents per 100,000 Population	-- If population data is included, use it to normalize accident data.

Accident Severity Index -- 	A custom index = (Fatalities + Serious Injuries) / Total Accidents.

Year/Month with Most Accidents -- 	Temporal trend to identify when most accidents occur.

Most Common Accident Type -- 	Type of accident (e.g., head-on, side-impact) that occurs most frequently.

% Change YoY--	Year-over-year change in accident numbers or fatalities.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Identified the top states with the highest accident rates.
- Highlighted months/years with peak accidents and fatalities.
- Categorized accidents by severity and type.
- Created interactive visualizations for easier understanding.
- Used conditional formatting to flag high-risk areas.
